#### 
**Prompt:** 
Select one website and create a Userscript-based Chrome extension that swaps out existing material on the site with something else. For example, you might replace all the ads on CNN.com with images from the Washington Post, or perhaps youâ€™ll replace all profile images on Facebook with bits of text. Consider the implications of your choices.

**Project Analysis:** For my project, I created a Chrome extension that takes every H, T, M, and L that can be (reasonably) pulled from a web page, capitalizes it, and makes it the color green. I chose to emphasize these letters to pay tribute to the HTML behind the web page.

- Still in development, has some bugs
